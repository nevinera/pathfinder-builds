## Notes:

enforcer + shatter-defenses allows for:
* first attack in flurry is nonlethal - free initimidate check to inflict 'shaken'
* second attack shatters defenses, causing him to be flat-footed to your attacks
  until the *end* of your next turn.
* Sneak attack dice for the rest of the flurry and the whole next flurry.
