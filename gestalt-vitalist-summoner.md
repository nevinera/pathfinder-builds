## Intent

This complicated build attempts to solve the gestalt action economy problem in several ways:
1. Unchained Summoner's eidolon gets its own actions, and doesn't rely on PC stats
2. Vitalist has several ways to maintain health in group while attacking

The overall plan here is that the Eidolon should be in melee combat while the PC stands
at midrange adding foes to the collective, and then draining their health into the team.
