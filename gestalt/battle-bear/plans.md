# Battle Bear

The Battle Bear is a gestalt that advances maneuvers and divine casting on one
side, merging the Stalker(Soul Hunter) 2, Cleric 3 into a Battle Templar at level 6.
(We'll need to use the Martial Tradition "Defenders of the Realm" in order to get
access, since Stalkers don't have Iron Tortoise or Golden Lion at all).

The other side of the gestalt will level straight up Druid. A full second divine
class and spell progression gets us a LOT of spells to (a) cast for utility and
(b) burn into Templar class features (Hexes provide some nice features too), and
a wilshaper with maneuver progression and Templar features will work particularly
well.

You are going to fully progress one Tier 1 class, and get all but three levels
progressing the spells of the other. If there's a tier zero, you're in it.

This needs to be run past the GM - dual-class progression is generally off-limits,
but a lot of GMs are ok with it as long as the gestalt isn't being abused - the
prerequisites for Templar are being met all from the same side.

We also have to ask how caster progression will be handled in a gestalt. Since cleric
and druid both grant prepared divine spellcasting, your GM may rule that you don't
get it from both sides. If so, this gestalt will not work - there's no good caster
combination available.
