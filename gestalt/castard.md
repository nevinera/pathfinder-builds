# Gestalt Mystic Theurge

* Grippli (Dex/Wis bonus, small size, 30' speed, climb 20, darkvision

This one's a bit more complicated.

1. First, we need 1 level of Stalker on the Left (soul hunter). We'll be taking 2 more later.
   This is for the ninja invisibility trick, to allow us to stay alive while we power out the
   spells. Also, the Steel Serpent level 1 stance 'body of the night' is *crazy* for stealthing.
2. We'll then take 3 levels of Cleric (or druid) on the left, and four levels of Empyreal Sorcerer
   on the Right. That's to get us Arcane AND Divine casting on Wis at second rank.
3. Now the Right side is going to take 10 levels of Mystic Theurge to keep our spell progression
   online.
4. On the left, in the meanwhile, we'll take vitalist 1, to get the healing network online.
   Being able to cure across the network keeps us safe.
5. Next is Aegis 3 to get the body suit, dex bonus, speed, and utility. This opens up "Student
   of the Astral Suit" (Ultimate Psionics, p117), which gives us +4 Aegis levels for the purpose
   of customization availability and points - now we can grab those tasty level 5 Aegis abilities
   like Chameleon, and *Flight*. We'll have 10 points to play with here, effectively level 7.
6. Then Shadow Dancer 1 (for hide in plain sight, obviously)
7. Now Stalker 2 & 3 (we want alacrity for more movement, and to boost our invisibility duration x3)
8. UnMonk 1 gets us Wis+1 to AC and CMD, for a large defensive bonus
10. 2 more levels in vitalist, picking up 2nd level power access
11. Theurge is done, we still need to progress both caster types.
  - 6 levels of Cerebremancer (Ultimate Psionics p354) on the Right - progress Sorcerer casting and
    Vitalist powers.
  - 6 levels of Cleric on the Left (night domain + healing domain)

This functions as a *very stealthy* mobile caster with two full progressions. I ought to be a solid
healer via the network and cleric cure spells (spontaneous casting doesn't require class levels),
and I should also be a functional blaster/controller as a sorcerer. Tactically, I stay out of melee,
and if I wind up in melee, I vanish, move far away, and then resume.

At the end, we have:
* 20 levels of sorcerer progression,
* 19 levels of cleric progression
* 9 levels of vitalist
* 60-85' movement (and a climb speed - if I want to spend a point or two, I can get 60-85' there too)
* a seriously crazy stealth bonus (20 ranks stealth + 20 ranks Heal + 2 chameleon + 1 trait +
  4 dex + 3 class skill + a few other minor bonuses), along with hide in plain sight and several
  ways to get invisibility as a swift action.

### Alternative Build: More Psionics
This is simpler - we are going for three full caster classes in one. (Divine/Arcane/Psionic)
Not much else to it - pick up a few metamagic feats and rods - we'll lean on vitalist for the
heavy healing and play heavy blaster otherwise.

I won't play this for two man (too squishy), but it would be *amazing* in a larger party!
