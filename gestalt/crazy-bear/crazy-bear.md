We're playing with a Druid chassis here, because they're the most versatile
Tier 1 character - they can play melee, blaster, control, healer, etc.
The other side is going to dip several, to pick up bonuses to important
things for *all* of those roles, focusing on action-economy and passive wins.

### Aegis (Trailblazer)

We'll dip this either 1, 3, or 4. 1 unless Student of the Astral Suit is allowed,
because then we get most of the benefit of 7 levels of it. The multiple suits
will serve *very well* here: None of them are made of metal, so the Druid can
safely wear half-plate/breastplate/chain when it's appropriate. Being able to
switch suits (even when wildshaped) gives us a lot of flexibility - we can
switch to skinsuit for pursuit, heavy armor for a slugfest, etc.

Trailblazer gets us Rapid Adjustment (swift action to reconfigure for speed,
swim, burrow, etc), and at fourth level we get +2 untyped stealth bonus.

* d10
* full BAB

### Vitalist

We'll probably only get one level of this - the collective and collective
healing are worth a lot. The other possible target is three levels, for 
Telepathy and a 2nd level power (animal affinity, maybe?).

### Brawler

One level of Brawler right at the start - this gets us the +2 reflex bonus,
martial flexibility (4/day), brawler's cunning, improved unarmed strike

* Full BAB
* Good Reflexes
* d10

### Stalker

Three levels for Ki Pool, Deadly Strikes 1d6, level 2 maneuvers, 2 stances, Alacrity,
Vanishing Trick, +1 Dodge, Wis to init, Wis to Reflex saves. This is an amazing dip.

* 6 skills

### Shadowdancer

One level, for hide in plain sight.

* Good reflex save
* 6 skills

### Dips Progression

* Brawler 1
* Aegis (Trailblazer) 1
* Stalker 1
* Vitalist 1
* Stalker 2-3
* Aegis 2-3
