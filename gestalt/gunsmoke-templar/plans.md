# Gunsmoke Templar

This character uses the Gunsmoke Mystic down one side, and levels Cleric -> Battle Templar
on the other. Initiation and Casting stat is wisdom, and we need the Unorthodox
Method trait to pick up Golden Lion so we can qualify for Templar. Rather than a
reach weapon, like the Mystic Templar, we're going to use the Gunsmoke Mystic archetype
and use a firearm from range.

We aren't optimizing for damage - full attacks will probably not be important with this
build; we want to instead be able to perform strikes (often with boosts) every round,
without missing much.

* Initiating:
  - Gunsmoke Mystic 1-5
  - Animus Adept 1-5
  - Gunsmoke Mystic 6-10
* Casting
  - Cleric 1
  - Stalker 1 (Judge)
  - Cleric 2-4
  - Battle Templar 1-9
  - Cleric 5-10
* Abilities (starting): 14/10/10, 12/18+2/7
* Traits:
  - Unorthodox Method (Mithral Currant -> Golden Lion)
  - Magical Knack (Cleric)
* Cleric domains: Travel and Tactics
  - Stalker Inquisition: Conversion

* The battle templar levels advance (for me): cleric domains and channeling, stalker inquisition
* Stalker (Judge) 1 gets a lot of features:
  - ki pool of 5-6 for perception/sense motive bonus, discern lies, dispel magic while judging
  - Judge Inquisition (advances via Templar, not that it matters much): use wis for three cha skills
  - judgement 1/day (very flexible)
  - access to Steel Serpent for the stealth stance
  - a stalker art (which we use for a combat feat)
* Important Skills (we'll have 6 skill points per level)
  * Full Ranks of Stealth (For stealth and Veiled Moon)
  * Full Ranks of Heal (For stealth, and Steel Serpent)
  * Full Ranks of Perception (for Solar Wind, and because it's awesome)
  * 5 ranks of Spellcraft
  * 5 ranks of Know(martial)
  * 2 ranks of Know(religion)
  * Full Ranks of Sleight of Hand (for Tempest Gale)
