# Mystic Templar

This character uses the Mystic down one side, and levels Cleric -> Battle Templar
on the other. Initiation and Casting stat is wisdom, and we need the Unorthodox
Method trait to pick up Golden Lion so we can qualify for Templar.

* Initiating:
  - Mystic 1-5
  - Animus Adept 1-5
  - Mystic 6-10
* Casting
  - Cleric 1
  - Stalker 1 (Judge)
  - Cleric 2-4
  - Battle Templar 1-9
  - Cleric 5-10
* Abilities (starting): 14/10/10, 12/18+2/7
* Traits:
  - Unorthodox Method (Solar Wind -> Golden Lion)
  - Magical Knack (Cleric)
* Cleric domains: Travel and Tactics
  - Stalker Inquisition: Conversion

* The battle templar levels advance (for me): cleric domains and channeling, stalker inquisition
* Stalker (Judge) 1 gets a lot of features:
  - ki pool of 5-6 for vanish, perception/sense motive bonus, discern lies, dispel magic. Since
    the ki is actually useful for a judge, consider taking alacrity instead of vanish?
  - Judge Inquisition (advances via Templar, not that it matters much): use wis for three cha skills
  - judgement 1/day (very flexible)
  - access to Steel Serpent for the stealth stance
* Important Skills (we'll have 6 skill points per level)
  * Full Ranks of Stealth
  * Full Ranks of Heal
  * Full Ranks of Perception
  * 5 ranks of Spellcraft
  * 5 ranks of Know(martial)
  * 2 ranks of Know(religion)
