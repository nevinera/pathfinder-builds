# Questions for Ben

1. Is Dark Tempest ok? It's a dual-advancement class, but I'm advancing one of
   those classes anyway.
2. Detect Psionics - is it detect magic? Psionic-Magic interaction has several options
3. How do you intend to work the HiPS from Veiled Moon Mystery? It doesn't mention shadow,
   but it also doesn't define what it means (and there are several competing definitions
   already, none of which match).
4. Downtime in campaign - I have some choices that would be *terrible* if I can't count
   on having days of downtime at least every 1-2 levels (Psycrystal Imprinter).
