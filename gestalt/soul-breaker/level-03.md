### Active
* Large Soul Bolt +9 19-20/x2 (40') (d8+6+d6f); +1/+1 if within 30'
  - Large Full Attack: 2x Bolt+7 (d8+6+d6f); +1/+1 if within 30'
* Maneuvers (3 readied)
  - [ ] Inner Sense: (immediate) +2 insight bonus to a single saving throw
  - [ ] Horizon Wind Lancet: (swift) +1d6 damage to first ranged attack
  - [ ] Solar Sting: (std): Atk vs 5AC on location - 10x10 square covered in vicious caltrops.
        Moving into or fighting in a square causes a caltrop+5 attack; they get +2AC for boots,
        but don't get shield, armor, or deflection bonuses. Caused 1d2 damage, halves their move
        speed for 24 hours (or until a DC 20 Heal check).
  - [ ] Steady Hand: (swift) increases first range increment of an attack by 30'
  - [ ] Curving Ray Shot: (standard) Before attack, roll percept against AC. Bypass cover if so.
* Recover Maneuvers: Full round with counterattacks for being attacked (max 1/foe, 5/round)
* Stance of Piercing Rays: Ranged attacks inflict an extra 1d6 of fire damage (included)
* Transfer wounds 1d6 (8/day) (touch): take x=1d6 nonlethal damage to heal x+2 normal to another
* Psionic Knacks (0pp)
  - Halt Death: Automatically stabilize a member of the collective []
  - Detect Psionics: (just like detect magic) [AV]
  - Sicken Body: DC 15 Will save, or sickened until the start of your next turn [OV]
* Psionic Powers:
  - *Natural Healing: + 3hp (network only) [AV]
  - Collapse (1pp): DC 16 Fort save, or falls prone [A]
  - Thicken Skin: +1 AC (network only) [MO]

### Passive
* No penalty for shooting into melee
* Rapid Adjustment: Switch up to three points as a swift action among:
  - Speed (1): +5' movement speed (all three points by default)
  - Darkvision (1): 60' darkvision
  - Climb (2): climb speed at half land speed
  - Swim (1): swim speed at base speed
  - Underwater Breath (1): can safely breathe underwater
* Health Sense: Swift action to get hp totals, standard action to check for poison/disease (DB 15)
* Network spells can now be augmented for 1pp to affect an extra collective member.
* May expend focus to ignore range penalties for one attack (still limited by 10x40')
