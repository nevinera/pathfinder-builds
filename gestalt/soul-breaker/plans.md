# Gestalt

* Race: Human
  - Use Heart of the Slums racial alternative (replaces Skilled)
* Class A: Soulknife (Warsoul, Soulbolt)
* Class B: Vitalist (Sadist) 4 -> Aegis (Trailblazer) 1 -> Metamind 4 -> Dark Tempest 10
* Abilities: 7/15/12, 10/20/8
* Traits
  - Wisdom in the Flesh: Use wisdom instead of Strength for Swimming. It is a class skill
  - Highlander (Hills or Mountains): +1 bonus to stealth. +2 in hills or rocky areas.

### Notes
* Dark Tempest would be a 2-class cheese move, but I'm taking levels of soulknife at the same time,
  so I'm not getting the benefits of multiple advancment. Hopefully that makes it ok.
* We delay psionic advancement by two levels - aegis doesn't advance at all, and metamind skips
  one level in favor of extra pp. This shouldn't affect our ability to heal too greatly - the extra
  pp ought to help more than that hurts.
* Full Maneuver progression, nearly full psionic progression, and good action-economy. Dark Tempest
  also opens up a bunch of combat powers, which can allow a lot of utility for my Vitalist (keep in
  mind that vitalists repick their powers each morning).
* Focused offense bladeskill allows us to use wisdom for attack/damage.
* Aegis level could be vitalist for 1 level of progression, or anything else - aegis dip seems good
* We want to use the *short* range soulbolt, which requires both hands (still allows a buckler)
  so that we get our strength added to damage, because otherwise focused offense doesn't give us
  wisdom to damage. We'll put up with no bonus for a bit (using the medium form with 60' range)
  until we can get focused offense and extended range together.
* The "Weapon Special" bladeskill is not disallowed for mindbolt, and can add trip to my bolt. Good
  synergy with the trip-warder. http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?223943-PF-DSP-Soulbolt-Ranged-Trip
* Cloak Dance feat at level 9 gives us a gimped HiPS - we just need to take a move action each round
* Chameleon psionic power is level 1, but not accessible. Possibly worth a feat (+10 stealth)
* Sadist loses knacks for a minor and a huge benefit:
  - losing a collective member is good instead of bad. This is nice because constructs can be in it
  - deal extra bleed damage *every time you hurt something*. Fort save will be irritating.
* Detect Psionics is Detect Magic, but with an augment available to boost identify (2pp for +10)
  - http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers
* Powerful Strikes can boost the augments on your power strike
* Might want to get Focused defense - it's only active while fighting defensively, so we'll need
  to lose some attack to be sturdy. Overall, I think I'd rather just depend on Adam to keep them
  away from me.

### Alternatives

Instead of Metamind, we might take Psicrystal Imprinter - that gets us a *lot* of flexibility
later on with powers. It was clearly not designed with the Vitalist power selection system in
mind. This only works if we have enough downtime to imprint stuff though. Metamind exploits the
same flaws - we can pick top-level powers to sequester and get a lot of pp in exchange for
flexibility. Imprinter costs one more feat though - two crafting feats for consumables..

We could also try prestiging out of Soulknife into Soul Archer, but it doesn't get us that much.
Mostly we'd just get range, and trade a level of blade advancement for a feat and to resume
psychic strike advancement. Seems a bit sketchy though - not sure how to handle psychic strike
advancing in dark tempest too.

If we're stopping by level 15ish, we should probably drop Metamind entirely, and dip another
class - probably stalker(judge) at level 3. This would get us vanishing trick, Judgement (plus
dispell magic) 1/day, discern lies, and a Domain or Inquisition (Conversion gets wis instead of
cha for three skills, imprisonment gives useful entangles on ranged critical, Protection gives +1
to all saves, travel gets 10' movement), and save 1 feat. We still lose power advancement,
additionally lose PP advancement, but vanishing trick especially will help with how squishy I am.

Another option: Awakened Blade. It costs a LOT of skill points (15, none of which I'd get otherwise),
and two feats (one of which I wouldn't take). I only get 4 skill points per level, so it's probably
off the table, but it's a very interesting option. I could even take it on the Soulknife side
instead - it advances mindblade and martial disciplines, has full bab, and gives some nice bonuses
(uncanny dodge, several useful feats, AC and initiative bonuses).

We don't *have* to decide until level 5 hits, when we pick up psicrystal affinity - that's almost
wasted if we don't need it for metamind 1.

### Feats of interest
* Psychic Meditation (move action to refocus)
* Deep Focus (two focuses)
* Extra Bladeskill
* Weapon Focus: Soulblade
* Point Blank Shot: +1/+1 up to 30' away

  * Rapid Shot: full attacks get an extra attack, all get -2 to hit (Dex 13, PBS)
    * Manyshot: First shot fires an extra shot (Dex 17, BAB +6 req)
  * Psionic Shot: +1 damage, expend focus for +2d6
    * Knockdown Shot: pay focus, standard attack + Refl vs (10 + clvl/2 + wis) or prone. (Dex 15)

* Level 12: Close Range Expert (No AoO for ranged attacks)
* Level 12: Toppling Strike (from favored class)

### Playbook

We ought to be a very solid damage dealer (archery always is), and it'll be further
inflated by the stance and bladeskills. At level 8 I get HiPS via bladeskill - I'll
be stacking stealth bonuses and ranks for sure. On the other side, I start with a
simple Vitalist chassis, but PrC out of it fairly quickly into Metamind and Dark Tempest.

Dark Tempest is intended as a dual-advancement class for Soulknife and any Psionic class,
but since I'll be advancing soulknife directly hopefully Ben will allow it anyway. It gets
us a few nice treats alongside full psionic progression for vitalist - most importantly
it broadens the spell list quite a lot, and allows a spellstrike effect in combat now and
then. Metamind loses a bit of advancement in exchange for lots of PP - that's a solid win
for healing, and the psicrystal bonuses will make him VERY effective at spamming the heals
when necessary. Since I'll have the collective, that will sometimes be a good plan - let
Adam charge into a room full of mooks while I stay outside healing him and shooting
through the door.
