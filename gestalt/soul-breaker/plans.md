# Gestalt

* Race: Human
  - Use Heart of the Slums racial alternative (replaces Skilled)
* Class A: Soulknife (Warsoul, Soulbolt)
* Class B: Vitalist (Sadist) 4 -> Aegis (Trailblazer) 1 -> Metamind 4 -> Dark Tempest 10
* Abilities: 7/15/12, 10/20/8
* Traits
  - Wisdom in the Flesh: Use wisdom instead of Strength for Swimming. It is a class skill
  - Highlander (Hills or Mountains): +1 bonus to stealth. +2 in hills or rocky areas.

### Notes
* Dark Tempest would be a 2-class cheese move, but I'm taking levels of soulknife at the same time,
  so I'm not getting the benefits of multiple advancment. Hopefully that makes it ok.
* We delay psionic advancement by two levels - aegis doesn't advance at all, and metamind skips
  one level in favor of extra pp. This shouldn't affect our ability to heal too greatly - the extra
  pp ought to help more than that hurts.
* Full Maneuver progression, nearly full psionic progression, and good action-economy. Dark Tempest
  also opens up a bunch of combat powers, which can allow a lot of utility for my Vitalist (keep in
  mind that vitalists repick their powers each morning).
* Focused offense bladeskill allows us to use wisdom for attack/damage.
* Aegis level could be vitalist for 1 level of progression, or anything else - aegis dip seems good
* We want to use the *short* range soulbolt, which requires both hands (still allows a buckler)
  so that we get our strength added to damage, because otherwise focused offense doesn't give us
  wisdom to damage. We'll put up with no bonus for a bit (using the medium form with 60' range)
  until we can get focused offense and extended range together.
* The "Weapon Special" bladeskill is not disallowed for mindbolt, and can add trip to my bolt. Good
  synergy with the trip-warder. http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?223943-PF-DSP-Soulbolt-Ranged-Trip
* Cloak Dance feat at level 9 gives us a gimped HiPS - we just need to take a move action each round
* Chameleon psionic power is level 1, but not accessible. Possibly worth a feat (+10 stealth)
* Sadist loses knacks for a minor and a huge benefit:
  - losing a collective member is good instead of bad. This is nice because constructs can be in it
  - deal extra bleed damage *every time you hurt something*. Fort save will be irritating.
* Detect Psionics is Detect Magic, but with an augment available to boost identify (2pp for +10)

  * Precise Shot: No penalty shooting into melee
  * Rapid Shot: full attacks get an extra attack, all get -2 to hit (Dex 13, PBS)
    * Manyshot: First shot fires an extra shot (Dex 17, BAB +6 req)
  * Psionic Shot: +1 damage, expend focus for +2d6
    * Knockdown Shot: pay focus, standard attack + Refl vs (10 + clvl/2 + wis) or prone. (Dex 15)

### Playbook

We ought to be a very solid damage dealer (archery always is), and it'll be further
inflated by the stance and bladeskills. At level 8 I get HiPS via bladeskill - I'll
be stacking stealth bonuses and ranks for sure. On the other side, I start with a
simple Vitalist chassis, but PrC out of it fairly quickly into Metamind and Dark Tempest.

Dark Tempest is intended as a dual-advancement class for Soulknife and any Psionic class,
but since I'll be advancing soulknife directly hopefully Ben will allow it anyway. It gets
us a few nice treats alongside full psionic progression for vitalist - most importantly
it broadens the spell list quite a lot, and allows a spellstrike effect in combat now and
then. Metamind loses a bit of advancement in exchange for lots of PP - that's a solid win
for healing, and the psicrystal bonuses will make him VERY effective at spamming the heals
when necessary. Since I'll have the collective, that will sometimes be a good plan - let
Adam charge into a room full of mooks while I stay outside healing him and shooting
through the door.
