### Notes
* Not complicated - I'll be putting every rank in those four skills through level 6 at least.
* Dumping climb and swim because my astral suit can give me climb and swim speed as a swift action.
* Trailblazer gives ability to disarm magical traps. It's listed on an ability that comes online
  at level 3, but it's stated as a fact about the archetype, rather than a new ability. Ask Ben.
