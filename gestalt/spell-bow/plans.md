# Spell Bow

NOTE: This turns out to be too feat-intensive to build - we can't get bladecaster online
without gimping ranged damage for quite a while.

Abilities: 10/16/13, 17+2/8/7

The spellbow develops maneuvers on one side and arcane spellcasting on the other.

Left side goes:
* Warder (Hawkguard) 4
* Phoenix Champion 10
* Mage Hunter 6

Right side takes:
* Wizard 5
* Bladecaster 9
* Collegiate Arcanist 6

### Alternatives

Collegiate Arcanist is the least confident prestige class here - potential replacements:
* Cyphermage (1 feat) - bonuses to scroll casting
* Arcane Archer (1 level of casting) - bonuses to archery
* Loremaster (three feats, moderately useful) - bonuses to all sorts of stuff
* Harrower (1 feat) - strange random bonuses all over the place. Makes magic more complicated.
* Commoner - if your campaign isn't going past level 14, it doesn't matter, eh?

### Traits
* Magical Knack - We're only out one caster level.. but maybe.
