# Gestalt Vitalist/Stalker

Human Female, Jillian Durall

* Class 1: Vitalist (Life Leech, Sadist)
* Class 2: Stalker (Soul Hunter)

Lawful Neutral - I don't think I can pass a character this far into lifestealing
mechanics as being benevolent. She's actually a bit evil-leaning by nature, but
her alignment is firmly neutral out of love for her brother, who has been trying
to teach her to be Good since she was very small.

Jillian is ____'s sister - she is not a very nice person, but is very protective of
her older brother (which is ironic, as he's her Sworn Protector). She has no problem
with soulstealing, torturing, maiming, or doing anything else to those she considers
enemies - she doesn't draw joy from it, but does feel a kind of satisfaction at the
sensation of her enemies dying in her Network.
