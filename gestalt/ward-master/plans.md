### Playbook

We want to be a very effective tank, be able to deal lots of damage, add some occasional utility,
and stealth like a boss. In particular, I should be able to pose a sufficient threat to make sure
they won't just run past me - I'm going to stack up the counters and hold my ground with my zone
of defense. If things get too tense, I can vanish and run.

I'll be stacking Heal and Stealth skills and bonuses - by level 6 (Shadowdancer), we ought to be
able to stealth right past a lot of groups. When that's not a good option, we can get a surprise
round every combat.

The two-weapon fisticuffs appears to scale well enough to qualify as a serious damage dealer, when
I don't need to spend my rounds defending. Flowing Monk will allow me to trip and abuse anyone
focusing on me.

Finally, I can trip. I can trip a lot of guys, and kick them on the way down (later on, twice each).
I get a free trip attempt on each full attack. At level 3 I can take a free AoO on them for going
prone, at level 9 I can take *another* free AoO on them for being tripped. At this point they are
prone, for -4 to attack - if they had more attacks to make, it won't hurt much. Even better,
once I get the 'push' feature online on my astral suit, I can use that AoO (the second one
if I had two) to push them one square away, where they probably can't even hit me. Tack it onto
the normal Warder Zone of Control, and we are looking at a lot of prone guys with a lot of kicked
faces - I can Trip *as* my AoO, which provokes 1-2 more AoOs. Though I may not want to take
them - I only have 5-6 per round, and making everyone prone is usually better than killing one guy.
Cause standing up from prone provokes an AoO.. and when you give a moose a muffin..

The tripping part of the build is most of the reason we want four levels of Magus later - enlarge
person gets me a HUGE threatened zone, even without my full-round action. I take up four
squares, and I get a reach of 10', which means there's a 6x6 block of threatened area around me.
Magus can cast arcane spells in light armor, and can spend arcane points to recall spells. Four
levels of Magus gets us a level 2 spell and 12 level 1 spells (spell recall with 7 arcane points).
That's 12 enlarge person casts, each lasting 4 minutes. It's hard to sneak around while large,
but by that point I'll generally be able to precast and then pounce into combat.
