# Gestalt

* Race: Halfling
* Class 1: Wilder 20
* Class 2: Support Dips
* Abilities: 6/9/12, 12/14/20

The objective here is to play a sneaky blaster that can heal reasonably well
and provide utility via psionic powers. To that end, I will be spending most
of my feats on extra powers, and my dips will focus on making blasting/healing
more viable.

### Dips

* Stalker 1 (Soul Hunter): The stealth stance is pretty impressive later, and soul burn is solid
* Vitalist 3: Collective Healing, Telepathy, and early healing powers
* Aegis 3: The utility from Aegis + Student of the Astral Suit is huge
* Ninja X: Sneak attack blasting, ki pool from Cha, ki powers (vanishing trick!)
* Paladin 2: Divine Grace, Smite evil (AC and to-hit from Cha), 4d6 of LoH per day, detect evil
* Cleric 1: Protection Domain = +1 to all saves, Memory = reroll knowledges 5/day
* Oracle (seeker) 1: Legalistic curse, Lore Mystery: Sidestep Secret (Cha instead of Dex to AC
  and Refl), Tinkering from Seeker gets us trapfinding for nothing.
* Shadowdancer 1: Hide in Plain Sight
* Monk (Kata Master) 1: +2 Fort/Refl at first level - panache pool, dodge and skill deeds.
  - Vow of Truth for one extra ki point? I'm going to be legalistic anyway..
* Halfling Opportunist 4: sneak attack progression, +2 saves, trapspotter

### Dipping plan:

* Oracle 1            AC/Reflex boost, basic healing
* Vitalist 1          Wilder healing over Network
* Aegis 1             Get my speed on
* Paladin 1-2         +Cha to all saves. Smite affects spell touch attacks.
* Aegis 2-3           Student of the astral suit
* Ninja 1-2           Vanishing trick for safety
* Stalker 1           Extra trick, stealth stance
* Shadowdancer 1      Hide in Plain Sight
* Monk (Kata Master)  Panache pool from Cha, two deeds to use it (physical skills, dodge). +2 AC
* Cleric 1            +1 to all saves, Reroll knowledge skills 5/day (Protection, Memory)
* Opportunist 1-4     Saves, Aid, sneak attack, trapspotter
* Ninja 3-6           More sneak attack, ki, tricks.

### Playbook

The plan is to play ranged dps the majority of the time - let Adam tank his heart out
while I hide behind him killing everything. Wilders have crazy PP efficiency, so I really
should be able to blast basically all day. Secondarily, I have network healing and buffing,
and can throw buffs and heals on him as necessary.

I also have a variety of escape tricks - vanishing trick is far my favorite. You can safely heal
and buff while invisible - it doesn't break the condition. You can also 'indirectly' cause harm,
which I believe means I'll be able to summon if needed. I have Smite Evil 1/day - it doesn't boost
my *damage* much, but it definitely lets me land touch attack spells a lot better. Touch attack
powers from invis/stealth cause sneak damage, incidentally - even AoE ones. Lastly, we both will
be wearing Astral Suits, which means we can stack the speed up pretty far; his maneuvers and my
vanish will allow us to break from combat and run like hell.

Network healing and Student Surge (lots of extra powers from elsewhere) will allow me to be a
tolerably effective burst healer (I have a ton of PP); I can pick up the psionic wand equivalent
to be a decent out-of-combat healer, and my bursts will allow me to heal a LOT with very little
PP (by dazzling myself, which doesn't much affect healing). Later on, we'll use a TON of feats to
pick up utility powers (summoning, levitation, controlling, etc). 

A secondary objective is to be sufficiently good at stealth to be a functional scout - the stealth
stance from Stalker, and hide in plain sight will certainly do it, especially in a dungeon campaign.
I'm not totally certain about the level order - if scouting turns out to be more important, HiPS may
move up as far as level 6 (before Aegis 1-3). Being a halfling helps, of course.

Did I mention awesome saves? Paladin 2 gives us +cha to every save, cleric 1 gives us +1 to all,
halfling gives +1 to all. Sidestep may swap Cha for Dex on Reflexes (For another +5) - it depends
on your interpretation of http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9sgk - in my opinion
it should work properly, but apparently lots of people think otherwise; I'll need to check with
Ben before taking that revelation. Since we'll be stacking cha bonuses asap, that ought to be
7/9/11 by level 8 even without any advancement. Having a good class on every save gets us 2/2/2,
and the progression looks like about 50/50 for Fort and Refl (all good for will) - that means we
should have 9/11/13 + 3/3/4 -> 12/14/17 at level 8 (roughly). If Sidestep stacks, we'll have
9/18/13 instead.

Cleric (Knowledge domain) for all knowledges as class skills and Oracle (Lore) revelations (extra
revelation feat for cha on knowledges) should let us play as a soft scholar. Might take another
revelation for CHA/day chances to get +20 with a short trance (focused trance revelation). That'll
let us play knowledge hardball when we need to. We'll have 6 skills per level (a bit more sometimes)
which means it'll take a bit to get a point on every knowledge skill while capping heal, stealth,
Disable Device, and UMD - we'll also need 5 ranks in Perform(Dance) for shadowdancer. I'm willing
to spend a couple of feats and traits to be effective as a skillmonkey.
