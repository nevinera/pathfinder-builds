# Zealous Templar

* Race: Human
* Class A: Zealot 20
* Class B: Oracle 5/Battle Templar 9/???
* Abilities: 16+2/10/12, 10/8/16+2 (Dual Talented)
* Traits: Reactionary
* Role: Striker and Healer

### Notes
* Battle Templar would be a two-class cheese move, but we're progressing maneuvers
  anyway, so the multi-advancement part isn't relevant. Hopefully your GM won't mind.
* Great action economy - Templar gets you all sorts of ways to use your spells without
  stopping to actually cast them, and you start to get free healing just for hitting things
  at mid-levels.
* We're going to be Str/Cha dependent, and Cha is really important. We're probably not going
  to top any damage charts, and we aren't optimizing for that.
* We're going to wear serious armor this time - dex above 12 will be totally wasted.
* We'll be fighting with a two-hander, probably with reach.
* BT specifically mentions "Channeling", but the language is fuzzy. We're going to assume
  that it advances channeling from the Oracle of Life revelation too, but check with your GM.

### Alternatives

If casting is really important to you, you might want to take two more oracle levels instead
of paladin 2. That gets you a whole level of spells extra, which can make a real utility
difference. It doesn't get you much else though.

Likewise, you could consider Paladin 5/Templar 9 - that loses you a LOT of spells, but
can pick you up some extra defensive capabilities via archetypes, or tactical options
