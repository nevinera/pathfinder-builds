# Zealous Templar

* Race: Human (Consider Elan)
* Class A: Zealot 20
* Class B: Oracle 3/Paladin 2/Battle Templar 9/Oracle 6
* Abilities: 16+2/10/12, 10/8/16+2 (Dual Talented)
* Traits: Magical Knack (Oracle), Reactionary
* Role: Tank and Healer (yes, at the same time)

### Notes
* Battle Templar would be a two-class cheese move, but we're progressing maneuvers
  anyway, so the multi-advancement part isn't relevant. Hopefully your GM won't mind.
* We're delaying Oracle casting by an extra two levels to get some paladin perks: Divine
  Grace and  LoH. BT progresses LoH for us, and Divine Grace is AWESOME for any Cha character.
  At 1/day, Smite Evil won't be a game-changer, but it is really nice to have when you need it.
* Full Maneuver Progression - the new available disciplines are awesome for tanking.
* Great action economy - Templar gets you all sorts of ways to use your spells without
  stopping to actually cast them.
* We're going to be Str/Cha dependent, and Cha is really important. We're probably not going
  to top any damage charts, and we aren't optimizing for that.
* We're going to wear serious armor this time - dex above 12 will be totally wasted.
* We'll be fighting with a two-hander and a buckler.
* Elan would get us the ability to spend Xpp to reduce taken damage by 2x as immediate action.
* In my games, I'm going to rule that Revelations are progressed instead of Curses - that seems
  more in-line with the domain advancement clerics get (Channel, for example, is an oracle
  revelation, and is explicitly advanced by Templar). I'll build this character that way -
  if it gets play on someone else's game who doesn't feel the same way, then you'll need to
  change your revelations and possibly your mystery.

### Alternatives

If casting is really important to you, you might want to take two more oracle levels instead
of paladin 2. That gets you a whole level of spells extra, which can make a real utility
difference. It doesn't get you much else though.

Likewise, you could consider Paladin 5/Templar 9 - that loses you a LOT of spells, but
can pick you up some extra defensive capabilities via archetypes, or tactical options
