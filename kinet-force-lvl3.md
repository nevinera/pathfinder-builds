Shroud of Water (Elemental Defense):
  Water, Burn 0
  You surround yourself with a shroud of water, ice, or both that protects you from harm. The
  shroud can either cover your body, functioning as armor, or float around you and block attacks,
  functioning as a shield. It grants either a +4 armor bonus to AC or a +2 shield bonus to AC, and
  you can change the type of bonus as a standard action. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4
  kineticist levels you possess beyond 2nd. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can increase the
  bonus by 1 until the next time your burn is removed. You can increase the bonus multiple times in
  this way, but it can’t be increased by more than 50% of its starting value. When you change the
  shroud to grant a shield bonus, any bonus in excess of this limit doesn’t apply, but it remains
  if you change the shroud’s bonus type again. Whenever you accept burn while using a water wild
  talent, the water coalescing around you allows your shroud to grant both the armor bonus and the
  shield bonus for 1 round. You can dismiss or restore this effect as an immediate action.

Elemental Overflow:
  If you have any burn, you are *obviously* a kinet
  Receive a +1 on blast attack rolls if you have any burn
  Receive a +2 on blast damage rolls if you have any burn

Kinetic Healer:
  Water, Utility, Burn 1

  With a touch, you can heal a willing living creature of an amount of damage equal to your kinetic
  blast’s damage. Instead of paying the burn cost yourself, you can cause the recipient to take 1
  point of burn. If you do so, the recipient takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per Hit Die he
  possesses, as usual for burn; this damage can’t be healed by any means until the recipient takes
  a full night’s rest.

15 skill points (5/lvl)



Notes:

Typical attack round (no net burn):
1. Move, then blast
2. Charge 1, then blast with pushing or range

This kinet is built as a ranged damage/controller. It cannot compete with archery
for net damage (in any form - a kineticist archer shooting arrows would probably
still beat a blasting kinet), but it gets some versatility and burst from the talents
and burn, and its throughput is very dependable because of the touch attack aspect.
