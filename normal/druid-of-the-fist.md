Notes - going to need:
0. Guided AoMF (wisdom to attack/damage)
1. weapon focus (claw)
2. Feral combat training (claw)
3. Multiattack
4. Hag Claws: +1 attack/damage with claws
Difficult - multiattack happens at level 15!
If we can get claws some other way, we free a human bonus feat up,
and if we can get an extra feat

New Concept: Changeling Druid using guided aomf to be effective in melee from only wisdom.
We don't need all the feats, cause we're not trying to be a melee powerhouse, just effective.
So we'll shift to tiger form, use aomf to get wisdom everywhere, natural casting,
