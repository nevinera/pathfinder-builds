## Concept

The oracle(life) gets a feature called 'life link' that
moves damage 5hp at a time from linked characters to self.
Add alongside this a way to perform self-healing as a swift action
(lay on hands), and you can be a party healer while remaining effective
as a combatant.

## Core Requirements

A few levels of life oracle for lifelinks (one per level) - I'd dip two levels fairly early.
Lots of hp (you're a gas tank)
Ways to heal yourself quickly

## Build

Looking like.. Oracle 4/Paladin 8 (POPPOOOPPPPP)

Str 16
Dex 10
Con 14
Int 7
Wis 9
Cha 16

Feat "Fast Healer": add conmond / 2 to all heals to yourself.
  requires 'endurance' and 'die hard'. Any way to pick it up without endurance?
  Die Hard is useful on its own for our build
Feat "Toughness": More hp.

Item "Boots of the Earth": 5000gp, stand your ground and gain 1hp/round
Item "Meditation Crystal": 100gp each, store channels to recharge LoH later (not in combat)
Item "Bracers of the Merciful Knight": 15.6k gp, +4 levels for per-day and power of LoH.
Item "Headband of Alluring Charisma": 4k gp for +2 cha
Item "Insignia of Valor": 8k gp - whenever you kill something with smite,
      you get to channel as a swift.
Item "Phylactery of Positive Channeling": 11k gp - channels get +2 dice
