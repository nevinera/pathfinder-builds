## Level 1

1. Magical Lineage: Metamagic costs one less

                  Knowledge(local) is a class skill for you
Feats:
1. Eschew Materials: spells don't need cheap components
2. Boon Companion: Sylvan Pet is full-level

   (touch spells at range, close spells from far away).

Appraise, Bluff, Craft, Fly, Intimidate,
Knowledge (arcana, local, nature, engineering),
Profession, Spellcraft, UMD

Spells Known: (-1 per level for crossblooded)
0xx: Detect Magic, Daze, Light
1x4: Enlarge Person

Arcane Bloodline Arcana: Metamagic that costs gives +1 DC
Sylvan Bloodline Arcana + level 1 power: Druid pet!

Plans:

Keep UMD up, boost knowledges/spellcraft.

Early plan is to get full druid pet and use share spells to buff him.

Arcane bond at level 3 gets us a full familiar ALSO - we want something
with opposable thumbs, for sure - the ability to get clever with traps
will eventually be valuable. Consider familiar archetypes? Sage might be
an alternative to pumping skill points and a trait into knowledge skills.

VMC summoner gets us a (weak) eidolon at level 7 - the long summons at
level 3 is also pretty handy (probably better than a feat).

Later, we're building toward a controller with good knowledge coverage and
a LOT of bodies on the field. It will be totally reasonable for this
character to do four things simultaneously.
