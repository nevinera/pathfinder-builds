## Sneaky Builds

1. UnRogue/UnSummoner - dex-cha - can make a sneaky pet for flanking, gets significant buff-casting
2. UnMonk/Druid - dex/wis - tough without armor, full caster, sneaky pet, wildshape shenanigans, wisdom/str.
3. UnRogue(3)+Magus/Wizard - dex-int - magus with full casting and stealth bonuses. Fragile.
4. Kinet(OverSoul)/Sorcerer(Shadow) - cha-based blaster with utility. Fragile, sniper.
5. Slayer/Monk(Nimble Guardian) - DEX - natural attacks with a precision/flurry build. Dirty Tricks for FF

## Tough Builds

1. Paladin/Oracle(Life) - full bore oradin build
2. UnMonk/Wildshaper - focus on maneuvers and claws - catfolk
3. Inquisitor/Paladin - very effective in Melee, wide divine casting
4. Paladin/Summoner - tough melee with big companion.
5. SoulKnife/Cleric
6. Empyreal Sorcerer/Vitalist - WIS - healer/blaster
7. Sylvan Sorcerer/UnSummoner - CHA - two full pets to buff
8. UnSummoner/Kinet(OverSoul) - CHA - good action economy. Shame overwhelming soul is so weak
9. Vitalist(SoulThief,LifeLeech,Sadist)/UnSummoner - WIS/cha

Any of these might consider a Bard VMC for bardic knowledge, Oracle VMC for lifelink (if paladin)..

Vitalist(SoulThief)/Soulknife(DeadlyFist-wisknife)
