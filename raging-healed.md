## Concept

This character is a bloodrager 1, skald X.
The concept is that we play almost a stock skald
(skillbot, buffs, etc), but we dip one level of blood
rager to give our rage an extra +2/+2 for ourselves,
and use the aberrant bloodline to pick up a tumor familiar
with the valet tumor type (which shares teamwork feats with
its owner). Then we pick up Amplified Rage to get a +4/+4
bonus to our raging, for a total of +8 str/con for ourselves
(still only +2 for our allies). This can all happen by level 2.

We accept a low con, because fast healing will keep us up anyway.
We can by level 4 get our active strength up to 28 with no items.
At that point, we'd have 21 rounds of song per day.

We'd also be a decent skillbot, with 6 skills per level, and the
ability to (a) use bardic knowledge, (b) double up skills using
versatile performance. We get quite a bit of versatility with
magic as well, thanks to spell-kenning..

Add in a Ring of Tactical Precision, and we can share that teamwork
feat around a little, allowing Ben to share in the rage fest - if
he has raging of his own to do, then this gets a bit silly.
