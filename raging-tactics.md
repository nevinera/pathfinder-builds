## Concept

This is a munchkin build that attempts to party-buff to fairly crazy levels.
Using an approach described in this forum post:
http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2rif8?Skald-Build-Thread#4<F37>

We build a half-orc Paladin (Holy Tactician) 3, Skald X.
Our paladin takes the Amplified rage Teamwork Feat, and is
able to grant it to all nearby allies like an aura.

Then when he uses his raging song, everyone gets +6 to str and con.
Add in a few other cute bits, like skald's vigor for fast healing 6..
and he also gets to play skillbot, since skalds get a lot there.

## Problems

He's fairly limited on rounds per day of raging song.
   3 + chamod + 2/lvl + 1/lvl (favored class)
He doesn't do a lot for casters and dex players.x
   (barbs and bloodragers get even more)


## Build

Str 16 (+2)
Dex 10
Con 10
