probably want to max strength instead of dex
dex and wisdom contribute to ac essentially identically,
Maybe...

Str 18+2
Dex 14
Con 10
Int 7
Wis 14
Cha 7

AC bonuses from:

Wisdom bonus
Dexterity bonus
Shield of Faith (+2 deflection bonus)
Barkskin (+2 Natural Armor, scaling up to +5)
Cat's grace (+4 Dex = +2 AC)
Mage Armor (+4 AC) (armor bonus)

Monk's robe (13k gp, AC and unarmed damage treated as 5 monk levels higher)
belt of incredible dexterity (+2,+4,+6 == n*n*1000 gp)
bracers of armor (+1-6, n*n*1000 gp) (armor bonus)

Crane style: only -2 for fighting defensively, get an extra +1 dodge bonus
Crane wing: +2 dodge bonus against a picked target (one per round).
  Total defense action also allows you to deflect one attack that would otherwise hit you
Crane riposte: only -1 for fighting defensively,
  crane wing's target provokes AoO if he misses you (one per round) (even if full defending)
