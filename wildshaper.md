Human Mooncaller Druid

This druid will play largely as a melee combatant early, but has
enough Wisdom to be a solid caster later on. The expectation is
that she will be played as a wildshaper at early levels, but will
try to spend only a few feats on her combat prowess - she should
become an increasingly capable caster as the levels increase.
After level 10-11, she will begin playing a casting-focused role
in major or dangerous fights, and by level 14-15 she should be
spending several rounds casting in most combat situations, and
will stop maintaining spell-slot buffs on herself.
